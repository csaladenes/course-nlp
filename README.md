# nlp 2022

Code-first, hand-on approach 
 - presenting a specific NLP topics using Notebook environment (e.g: Colab)
 - using most popular NLP libararies and tools

## Topics

- Introduction
- scikit-learn - 
- NLTK - (sentiment analysis)
- spacy - (LDA/LSA)
- huggingface - (translation?)
- fast.ai - (speech-to-text, text-to-speech)
- Alexa use case presentation?


### NLP Tasks

- Part-of-speech tagging / Named entity recognition
- Topic modeling (topic information extraction)
- Text-to-speech (audio generation, sythesis)
- Speech-to-text (speech recognition, transcription)
- Sentiment classification/analysis
- Language modeling (distribution based)
- Translation
- Text generation
- Text summarization
- Question answering
